After reading this I realized you need to be careful with how you implement something. Jesse created a search engine for RPI
students to use so that it would be easier to access information from the institute. Within the search engine were listed music files.
This is ok, but students began to download these music files which is illegal. Jesse never thought the students using the search engine
would do this. Eventually the RIAA filed a lawsuit against Jesse because he did not have a lincese to download and distribute these 
music files. The same thing can be said for taking open source software. We cannot take and distribute the source code because of the 
licenses for the files.
