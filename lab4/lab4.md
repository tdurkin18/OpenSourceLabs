## Licensing
Licensed under: CC-BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/

## Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
An open source project should have a license because it will make sure that the users do not use the software/source code with the wrong intent. Just because the software is free does not mean you can use it anyway you like.

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
You should not work on a project with an explicit license because of security issues. Most official open source projects
are backed by a license, so working on a project without a license is risky.

## Do you agree with this claim? 
I agree with the claim because the Web did everything better than Gopher. The Gopher team did not follow the Internet standards as well as the Web community. Also Gopher did not try to focus on one approach which ultimate lead to their downfall.

## Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?
